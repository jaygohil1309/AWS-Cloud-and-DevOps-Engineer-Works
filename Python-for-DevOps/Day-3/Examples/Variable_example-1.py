*** Variable Lifetime: The lifetime of a variable is determined by when it is created and
                       when it is destroyed or goes out of scope. Local variables exist only while the function is being executed, while global variables exist for the entire duration of the program.

*** Variable Naming Conventions and Best Practices:-

1)  It's important to follow naming conventions and best practices for variables to write
    clean and maintainable code:

2)  Variable names should be descriptive and indicate their purpose.

3)  Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (snake_case) for variable 
    names.

4)  Avoid using reserved words (keywords) for variable names.

5)  Choose meaningful names for variables.
