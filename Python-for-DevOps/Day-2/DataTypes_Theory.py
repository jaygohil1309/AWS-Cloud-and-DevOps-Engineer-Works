*** Data Types in Python :- 

==>> In programming, a data type is a classification or categorization that specifies 
     which type of a value a variable can hold. Data types are essantial because they
     determine how data is stored in memory and what operations can be performed on that
     data. Python, like many programming languages, supports several built-in data types.
     Here are some of the common data types in python.....

"""
# 1) Numeric Data Types :- int, float, complex....

x = 5 # int_type
y = 3.14 # Float_type
z = 2 + 3j # Complex_type

# 2) Sequence Types :- str, list, tuple....

text = "Hello, World" # Str_type
my_list = [1,2,3] # List_type
my_tuple = (1,2,3) # Tuple_type

# 3) Mapping Type :- dict......

my_dict = {1:"Jay", 2:"Vishvam", 3:"Kathan"} # Dict_type

# 4) Set Types :- Set, Frozenset.....

my_set = {1,2,3}
my_frozenset = frozenset([1,2,3])

# 5) Boolean Type :- bool [True or False].....

is_valid = True

# 6) Binary Types :- bytes, bytearray.....

data = b'Hello' # bytes.....
data = bytearray(b'Hello') # bytearray....

# 7) None Type :- Represent the [None] object, which is used to indicate the absence
#                 of a value or a null value. 

# 8) Custom Data Types :- You can also define your custom data types using classes and objects.
