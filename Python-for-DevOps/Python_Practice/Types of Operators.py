# Arithmetic Operators :- 

a = 10
b = 2

# sum = a + b

print(a + b) # Addition
print(a - b) # Subtraction
print(a * b) # Multiplication
print(a / b) # Division
print(a % b) # Moduler
print(a ** b) # Power Using for Squere and Cube of any numbers.

# Relational Operators :-

a = 50
b = 10

print(a == b) # False
print(a != b) # True
